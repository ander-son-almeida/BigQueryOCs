This project consists of building a database using the BigQuery cloud service offered by Google Cloud Platform, to optimize the work of our astrophysics group and provide a large dataset using an SQL-like interface to execute queries.

For didactic purposes, a dashboard was created using the Jupyter Notebook in which a database query and the creation of interactive graphs with the plotly library were exemplified.
